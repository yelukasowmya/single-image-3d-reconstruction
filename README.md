# Single-Image 3D Reconstruction

A comprehensive pipeline for transforming 2D image into textured 3D model using AI-powered computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for reconstructing 3D models from single 2D image. The system utilizes multiple state-of-the-art computer vision techniques including object segmentation, depth estimation, synthetic view generation, voxel grid creation, and texture mapping to create detailed 3D representations from ordinary 2D photograph.

### Project Motivation

Traditional 3D reconstruction often requires multiple images or specialized equipment. This project aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging recent advances in AI and computer vision to generate plausible 3D models from a single image, making 3D content creation more accessible.

## Technical Architecture

### Pipeline Components and Workflow

1. **Object Segmentation (`segmentation.py`)**

   - Implements Mask R-CNN to isolate objects from backgrounds
   - Pre-trained on COCO dataset for recognizing 80+ common object categories
   - Outputs binary masks and segmented images

2. **Depth Estimation (`depth_estimation.py`, `depth_generator.py`)**

   - Utilizes MiDaS DPT_Large model for monocular depth estimation
   - Transforms 2D pixel information into relative depth values
   - Generates both raw depth maps and colored visualizations

3. **View Synthesis (`view_synthesizer.py`)**

   - Creates 8 synthetic viewpoints around the object
   - Implements novel view synthesis using 3D point cloud reprojection
   - Handles occlusion and performs hole-filling to create coherent views

4. **Voxel Grid Creation (`voxel_mesh.py`)**

   - Integrates multiple synthetic views into a consistent 3D representation
   - Implements space carving and volumetric fusion techniques
   - Creates 128³ resolution voxel grids with occupancy probability values

5. **Mesh Generation (`improved_voxel_to_mesh.py`)**

   - Converts voxel grids to triangular meshes using Marching Cubes algorithm
   - Applies Laplacian smoothing to reduce voxelization artifacts
   - Implements spherical UV mapping for texture projection

6. **Texture Mapping**

   - Projects original image colors onto the 3D mesh
   - Enhances color vibrancy and detail preservation
   - Generates textured meshes in standard 3D formats (OBJ and PLY)

7. **Evaluation Metrics (`evaluate.py`)**
   - Computes quantitative metrics for reconstruction quality
   - Supports comparison with ground truth models when available
   - Generates visual reports and performance benchmarks

### Algorithm Details

#### Object Segmentation

The segmentation module uses Mask R-CNN with a ResNet50-FPN backbone. The model performs instance segmentation, providing pixel-precise masks for detected objects. The system automatically selects the most prominent object based on mask area and confidence score.

#### Depth Estimation

The depth estimation pipeline uses MiDaS DPT_Large, a transformer-based architecture trained on diverse datasets. While the raw output provides relative depth values, the system applies normalization and refinement to enhance depth consistency at object boundaries.

#### Multi-View Synthesis

The view synthesis module implements a geometric approach where:

1. The original image and depth map are converted to a 3D point cloud
2. The point cloud is rotated around the vertical axis at predefined angles
3. Points are reprojected onto new virtual camera planes
4. Missing regions are filled using nearest-neighbor interpolation

#### Voxel Grid Construction

The voxel grid creation follows a probabilistic space carving approach:

1. Initialize an empty 128³ voxel grid
2. For each synthetic view:
   - Project rays from the camera through each pixel
   - Update voxel occupancy probabilities based on depth values
3. Combine evidence from all views using a weighted average
4. Apply threshold to determine final occupancy

#### Mesh Generation and Texturing

The mesh generation process:

1. Applies Marching Cubes algorithm to extract isosurfaces from the voxel grid
2. Performs Laplacian mesh smoothing to reduce staircase artifacts
3. Creates UV coordinates using spherical projection
4. Maps the original image texture onto the mesh using these coordinates
5. Exports in standard 3D formats (OBJ/PLY) with material files

#### Evaluation Metrics

The system includes comprehensive evaluation capabilities to quantify reconstruction quality:

### Accuracy Assessment

The system calculates an overall accuracy score along with detailed metrics:

1. **Topological Quality**

   - **Watertightness**: Indicates whether the mesh has no holes (binary score)
   - **Manifold Ratio**: Proportion of well-formed mesh edges (0-1 score)
   - **Structural Coherence**: Based on number of connected components (1 is optimal)

2. **Geometric Quality**

   - **Mesh Smoothness**: Measures surface transition smoothness (0-1 score)
   - **Edge Regularity**: Uniformity of edge lengths across the mesh (0-1 score)
   - **Symmetry Score**: Assessment of left-right symmetry (0-1 score)

3. **Mesh Statistics**
   - Vertex and face counts
   - Surface area and volume measurements
   - Vertex density metrics

### Visualization Tools

![Accuracy Radar Chart](data/output/evaluation/R_textured_accuracy_radar.png)

The system automatically generates visualizations to help assess quality:

1. **Radar Chart**: Shows six key dimensions of reconstruction quality on a 0-100% scale
2. **Bar Chart**: Displays detailed metrics with precise numeric values
3. **Comparison Charts**: When comparing different methods or parameters

### Detailed Reports

Each evaluation generates a comprehensive report with:

- Overall accuracy score as a percentage
- Detailed breakdown of all metrics
- Interpretation guide explaining the significance of each measurement
- Specific recommendations for improving reconstruction quality

## Using the Evaluation Tools

```bash

```

### Key Technical Challenges and Solutions

#### Handling Occlusions

- Challenge: Synthesizing views reveals previously occluded regions
